> I originally made this to use `HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS_PER_KEY` which ZSA's Oryx does not support. I have since significantly reworked my layout and don't use that feature anymore. I have thus switched back to using Oryx, so you can find my layout [here](https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/OWo09/latest/0). I may use this repo again if I ever need to switch back to QMK directly.
